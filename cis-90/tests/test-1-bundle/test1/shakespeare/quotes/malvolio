MALVOLIO

M, O, A, I; this simulation is not as the former: and
yet, to crush this a little, it would bow to me, for
every one of these letters are in my name. Soft!
here follows prose.

(Reads)

  'If this fall into thy hand, revolve. In my stars I
  am above thee; but be not afraid of greatness: some
  are born great, some achieve greatness, and some
  have greatness thrust upon 'em. Thy Fates open
  their hands; let thy blood and spirit embrace them;
  and, to inure thyself to what thou art like to be,
  cast thy humble slough and appear fresh. Be
  opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants; let
  thy tongue tang arguments of state; put thyself into
  the trick of singularity: she thus advises thee
  that sighs for thee. Remember who commended thy
  yellow stockings, and wished to see thee ever
  cross-gartered: I say, remember. Go to, thou art
  made, if thou desirest to be so; if not, let me see
  thee a steward still, the fellow of servants, and
  not worthy to touch Fortune's fingers. Farewell.
  She that would alter services with thee,
                          THE FORTUNATE-UNHAPPY. 

Daylight and champaign discovers not more: this is
open. I will be proud, I will read politic authors,
I will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off gross
acquaintance, I will be point-devise the very man.
I do not now fool myself, to let imagination jade
me; for every reason excites to this, that my lady
loves me. She did commend my yellow stockings of
late, she did praise my leg being cross-gartered;
and in this she manifests herself to my love, and
with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits
of her liking. I thank my stars I am happy. I will
be strange, stout, in yellow stockings, and
cross-gartered, even with the swiftness of putting
on. Jove and my stars be praised! Here is yet a
postscript.

(Reads)

  'Thou canst not choose but know who I am. If thou
  entertainest my love, let it appear in thy smiling;
  thy smiles become thee well; therefore in my
  presence still smile, dear my sweet, I prithee.'
  Jove, I thank thee: I will smile; I will do
  everything that thou wilt have me.
