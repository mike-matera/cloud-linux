ARIEL

My master through his art foresees the danger
That you, his friend, are in; and sends me forth--
For else his project dies--to keep them living.

Sings in GONZALO's ear

While you here do snoring lie,
Open-eyed conspiracy
His time doth take.
If of life you keep a care,
Shake off slumber, and beware:
Awake, awake!
