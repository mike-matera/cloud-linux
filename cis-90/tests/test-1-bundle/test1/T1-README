Steps for setting up Real Test 1

Canvas

1) Import Test 1 (real) from last term.

2) Adjust start time (last hour of Lesson 6) and end time 11:59 PM same day.

3) Configure accomodations.

son-of-opus (use son alias of Opus-II to login)

  As supersuser:

  1) Update and upgrade as necessary

  2) Delete old student accounts and add new student accounts
     cd cis90
     run: ./get-opus-account-files 
     run: ./get-prune-opus-accounts
     run: ./get-fix-opus-names
     (the new accounts will be locked)

  Note: You can control whether or not students can login using the lock-cis90 
        and unlock-cis90 scripts in /root/cis90.  This can be done manually or 
        scheduled with the at command.  For example if you want to unlock 
        son-of-opus at the last hour of Lesson 6 and lock again at midnight the same day:

        Fall term:
        echo "/root/cis90/unlock-cis90" | at 3:00pm oct 2
        echo "/root/cis90/lock-cis90" | at midnight oct 3

        Spring term:
        echo "/root/cis90/unlock-cis90" | at 11:00am mar 6
        echo "/root/cis90/lock-cis90" | at midnight mar 7

  3) If necessary put T1-flag-command in /usr/local/sbin as flag

  4) Test geocache file (IP address and mystery file) using dog account:
     su - simben90
     flag
     cat geocache
     (check the mystery file exists)
     exit 

sun-hwa-vii

1) Update/upgrade as needed.

2) Delete old student accounts, add new ones, remove drops, fix names:
     cd ~/test-accounts
     run: ./get-opus-account-files     
     run: ./get-prune-opus-accounts
     run: ./get-fix-opus-names
     (the new accounts will be locked)

     Note: You can control whether or not students can login using the lock-cis90
        and unlock-cis90 scripts in /root.  This can be done manually or
        scheduled with the at command.  For example if you want to unlock 
        sun-hwa-vii at the last hour of Lesson 6 and lock again at midnight the same day:

        Fall term:
        echo "/root/unlock-cis90" | at 3:00pm oct 2
        echo "/root/lock-cis90" | at midnight oct 3

        Spring term:
        echo "/root/unlock-cis90" | at 11:00pm mar 6
        echo "/root/lock-cis90" | at midnight mar 7 


3) cd ~/test1
   ./tweak-uids T1

4) Cause some path based trouble
   cd
   ./trouble-T1

5) Make a collection of files of random types
   cd ~/test1
   ./make-mfiles T1

6) Set up test
   cd ~/test1/shakespeare
   ./setup-shakespeare T1


opus-ii

  1) Schedule or manually run the following script (and arguments) to run when the test starts:

     manually run: ~/cis90/test01/q29/mail-q29-T1 2 q
     or echo "~/cis90/test01/q29/mail-q29-T1 2 q" | at 3:00PM wed

     This sends the email students need to answer Q29.

Test the test!

  Test everything using the questions on the Canvas quiz "Real Test 1" and one of the dog accounts
  on son-of-opus and sun-hwa-vii.   

  Update Q16 on Canvas to reflect the actual number lines output.  Note this changes every term
  with a different student headcount.  Running the get-prune-opus-accounts above should be done
  before editing the Q16 question text as this may reduce the number of student accounts.

  Update Q22 so the date matches the size of the /usr/share/doc/banshee/copyright file on sun-hwa-vii.  
  The size of this file can change after upgrades.
