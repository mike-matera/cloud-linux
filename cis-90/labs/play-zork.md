## Zork on Opus 

The Zork games were designed for computers that had no graphics! Here's a screencast of me playing Zork on Opus:

You can play Zork yourself by running the command:

```shell
$ zork 
```

## Turn In 

Play the game until you score some points or make at least 100 or so moves. Turn in a screenshot.
