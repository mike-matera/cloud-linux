# Get AWS Educate Credit

In this lab you'll claim your AWS Educate account.

## Introduction 

Your project will be done on an AWS virtual machine. Your VM will run continuously so that you can provide on demand services. That costs money. AWS Educate is a program where you receive AWS credit for taking the course. That way it's free for you. Unlike the free credit that you get for signing up with AWS, getting your credit through class means you don't need a credit card. 

## Step 1: Check Your Email

You should have received an email welcoming you to AWS Educate. Don't forget to check spam. 

## Step 2: Sign Up
