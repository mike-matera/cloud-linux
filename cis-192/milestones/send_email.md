# Receive Email 
 
In this milestone you will receive your first email. Before you begin you should verify your MX and SPF records are in place using dig. If your DNS records aren't setup don't try to send email, you will poison DNS and have to wait for the TTL to expire on your broken DNS records.

## Send Yourself Email 

Use your existing personal account (e.g. Gmail) to send email to yourself on your own domain:

```
ubuntu@<yourdomain>.cis.cabrillo.edu
```

If your DNS, firewall and Postfix are setup properly you will receive the email. When you have forward it to me at my Opus address.
