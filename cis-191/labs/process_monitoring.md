# Getting Answers about Processes 

When a machine is misbehaving you need to use tools to find answers. In this lab you'll download a program that'll ask you questions that you can answer using `ps` and other tools.

You need to install some infrastructure before you begin:

```
$ sudo apt install python3-pip 
$ pip3 install --user -U http://www.lifealgorithmic.com/dist/lifealgorithmic-0.0.2.tar.gz
```

Then download the grading script with the command:

```
$ wget http://opus.cis.cabrillo.edu/cis191/process_challenge.py
```

Then run it:

```
$ python3 ./process_challenge.py
```

The program asks you a series of questions. You will need to have a second shell open so that you can discover the answers. Get all the questions correct for a full score. You can run it as many times as you like. When you're satisfied with your score copy and paste the output into Canvas. The point total is not correct (it's weighted with the rest of this week's assignments)
