## Introduction

In this lab you will examine processes in depth. For this lab you will pick complex processes. Answer the questions in Part 1 and Part 2 for each of the following processes:
  * The X-Windows server (/usr/bin/X)
  * Firefox (/usr/lib/firefox/firefox)
  * compiz (The 3D compositor that makes your desktop pretty)

## Part 1: Find the Processor Stats

For this part you must use the tools you learned in class to determine some important statistics about the processes. When things go wrong with a process these are very important to know. With the process you picked answer the following questions:
  - How many threads does the process have?
  - What is the total amount of time the process has been running on the processor?
  - What is the total amount of memory the process is using?

## Part 2: File Descriptors

Find the open files that the process has and answer the following questions:
  - What files do STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR point to? Hint: If you don't know what those are Google "File descriptor"
  - What normal files does the process have open?

## Part 3: System Statistics

Now you will need to find information about your overall system.
  - How long has it been since your system has started?
  - How much free memory does your system have?
  - In the last second how many blocks have been read from and written to your disk?

## Turn In

Submit the answers to the above questions on Canvas. Remember you must answer each question in Part 1 and Part 2 for each of the three processes you are to examine.
