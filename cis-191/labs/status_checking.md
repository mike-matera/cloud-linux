For this lab you will execute commands that show you what's going on with a system. You can do this lab on your VM, opus or any other Linux system. For each question you will submit the command you used to find the answer and the answer that was given to you by the command:
  - When was the last time the system booted (what date and time)?
  - What is the average number of disk I/O requests that the system has made since boot?
  - What TCP ports are open (they have programs listening)?
  - How many open files are there on the system?
