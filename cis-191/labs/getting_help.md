# Getting Help

There's a wealth of information and help available for Linux. Good admins know how to get answers quickly. 

## Get Help 

When you've worked with Linux for a while there are some things you will never forget, like how to set the hostname. But when you're first getting started "little" things like that can be hard to figure out. Use a search engine to find out how to set a static IP address in Linux. The process is different between distributions. For example search for:

> How do I set a static IP address in Ubuntu?

Try other distributions like SUSE, Debian, Fedora and Centos. Use this search for at least two distributions and look through at least two answers per question. Make a note of what each answer tells you. Answer the following questions:

  - What sites came up in your searches?
  - What differences did you notice between distributions?
  - Was there a command that was common?
