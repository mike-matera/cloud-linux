There's a wealth of information and help available for Linux. Good admins know how to get answers quickly. 

# Get Help 

When you've worked with Linux for a while there are some things you will never forget, like how to set a machine's IP address. But when you're first getting started "little" things like that can be hard to figure out. Use your favorite search engine to find out how to set an interface's IP address in Linux. Ask for how to do it using different distros. Here's an example search:

> How do I set a static IP address in Ubuntu?

Use this search for at least two distributions and look through at least two answers per question. Make a note of what each answer tells you. Consider the following questions:

  - What sites came up in your searches?
  - What differences did you notice between different sites for the same search?
  - What differences did you notice between distributions?
  - Was there a command that was common?

You don't need to answer those questions for this lab but I would like you to answer and submit this question: 

  - Why do you want to learn Linux?

# Turn In 

Turn in the answer to why you want to learn Linux in a file named `why_learn_linux.txt`. Submit it on Canvas.
