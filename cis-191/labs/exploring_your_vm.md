# Accessing your VLab VM 

The purpose of this lab is to establish a connection to your VM and to take control of it as the root user.

## Using CIS Computers

The computers in the STEM center and in classrooms 828 and 829 are different from the other computers on campus. They are meant for students in CIS classes. Your regular username and password will not work. Use the following credentials on CIS computers:

 * <b>Username</b>: Student
 * <b>Password</b>: Cabri11o (a.k.a. funny Cabrillo)
 
It is not necessary that you complete the classwork on CIS computers.

## Using VCenter and VMWare

Most students will find it easiest to use the central servers to complete their lab assignments. Though you can do the assignments on your own computers you are responsible for setting up the proper VMs. In most cases that will be more trouble than it is worth.Access to VMWare happens via the web. You access the lab via this web page:

Your username and passwordIs an encoded version of your name where:

```
lll   : first 3 letters of your last name (lowercase)
fff   : first 3 letters of your first name (lowercase)
Ff    : first 2 letters of your first name (first letter uppercase)
Ll    : first 2 letters of your last name (first letter uppercase)
nnnn  : last 4 digits of your student ID
```
Your coded username and password is: 

```
 Username  : cislab\lllfff191 
 Password  : FfLlnnnn
```

Example:

```
Michael Matera (student ID 1234-567890)
username: cislab\matmic191
password: MiMa7890
```

## Your VMs

When you reach the VLab home screen you will see a screen similar to the screenshot below. The screenshot has the "VMs and Templates" link highlighted. Click that link to be able to find the class folder.

The class folder has a bunch of "StudentXX" folders. Take one for yourself by renaming it to your recognizable name. Do not access other student's VMs. All activity on VMware is logged! Your VMs are new and require initialization. The username on your VM is:

```
Username: student
Password: Cabri11o
```

When you are logged in to your VM's console take a screenshot.
