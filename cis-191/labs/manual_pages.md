# Manual Page Lab

Before you begin this lab, read the lesson:

> [Deciphering Manual Pages](../deciphering_manual_pages)

In this lab you will study the manual pages of commands to find the answers to questions.

Use the manual of ssh to learn how to use advanced features of SSH. For each of the questions you should submit a complete SSH command line. Each command line will be as if you're logging into opus. The base command is:

```
ssh -p 2220 student@opus.cis.cabrillo.edu 
```

Make commands to do each of the following:

  - Enable X11 forwarding
  - Turn on debugging output to the maximum level
  - Use an alternate configuration file (`/opt/ssh/config`)
  - Instead of getting a shell on opus, run the `who` command
