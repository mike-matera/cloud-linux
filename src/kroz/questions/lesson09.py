UNIX was designed from the start to be an operating system that lets multiple
users share the same computer. When multiple users share the same computer there
has to be limits on what any user can do, so that users can keep their private 
data safe. File permissions in UNIX do this by specifying three groups:

1. The owner of a file or directory 
1. The group the file or directory belongs to 
1. Everyone else
