In this lesson you'll learn some tricks to make your work faster and more efficient. 
You'll learn how to: 

1. Use the glob characters `*` and `?` 
1. Use Tab completion 
1. Use quotes and backslashes to change the meaning of characters 
1. Use command substitution

# Using Wildcard to Select Files 

In this walk through you'll use the `*` and `?` characters to have the shell 
*substitute* those characters onto your command line. Once you get the hang of 
globbing you'll be able to work faster and better. 

Let's start by going to your `~/Poems` directory:

```console
$ cd ~/Poems
```
                    """,
            filter=lambda cmd: cmd.command == "cd"

            """
# The Star 

The star `*` character is a wildcard that matches *zero or more* characters in a
file name. For example this shows us information about any file that starts with
the letter `s` in the `Shakespeare` directory:

```console
$ ls -l Shakespeare/s*
```
                    """,
            filter=lambda cmd: cmd.command == "ls"

        ),

            filter=lambda cmd: cmd.command == "ls"

# The `?` is More Restrictive 

The `?` wildcard character matches *zero or one* character in the name of a
file. If you want to see `sonnet10` but not `sonnet1` you can use the `?` like
this:

```console
$ ls -l Shakespeare/sonnet1?

# Command Substitution 

Command substitution takes the output of a command and puts it on the command
line. It's similar to a pipe, but a pipe connects streams. It can be a bit
confusing at first. So let's try a few examples. 

This command takes the output of `ls` and puts it on the command line for `echo`:

```console
$ echo $(ls)
```

Notice how echo shows the names of files in the current directory.

Here's a more practical example. The `which` command shows you the location of 
a command. Here's how to find the location of the `cp` command:

```console
$ which cp
/usr/bin/cp
```

What if we wanted to know more information about `cp`? We could use `ls`:

```console 
$ ls -l /usr/bin/cp 
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 141848 Apr  5  2024 /usr/bin/cp
``` 

But, we can do it in a single step with command substitution: 

```console
$ ls -l $(which cp)
```

# Quotes and Quoting 

Quotes change the way the shell interprets special characters. For example, 
without quotes the shell treats all consecutive spaces as a single space:

```console 
$ echo This is a                test
This is a test
```

Enter an `echo` and put lots of spaces in the argument.

When the spaces are *inside* quotes they lose their special meaning:

```console 
$ echo "This is a                test"
This is a                test
```

Put quotes around the arguments of your last command.

            filter=[lambda cmd: cmd.command == "echo"],
        ),
        Interaction(
            f"""
Double quotes allow some of the shell's special characters to still work. For  
example, the dollar sign `$` keeps its meaning:

```console 
$ echo "My name is $USER"
My name is {getpass.getuser()}
```
""",
            filter=[
                lambda cmd: cmd.command == "echo"

            ],
        ),
        Interaction(
            """
Single quotes are stronger. They don't let anything have a special meaning:

```console 
$ echo 'My name is $USER'
My name is $USER
```
""",
            filter=[
                lambda cmd: cmd.command == "echo"

            ],
        ),
        Interaction(
            """
It's possible to quote *just one character* with the backslash `\\` character.
Here's an example where the backslash only applies to the `$` character:

```console 
$ echo My name is \\$USER
My name is $USER
```

Here's a practical example that will help you later. The `\\` can take the 
meaning away from the single quote. To see all the files that contain a `'` you
can use the `*` like this:

$ ls *\\'*
```
